## :scroll: Description

Welcome to the repository for the Mercado Libre Android App Challenge! This project demonstrates a sample application designed to showcase a streamlined shopping experience, featuring three core screens:

Search Screen: Users can enter search queries to find products. The screen has a search bar and a logo.

Results Screen: This screen displays a list of products based on the user's search query. Each item in the list shows a brief overview, such as the product name, image, and price, allowing users to browse and select items for more details.

Product Detail Screen: Upon selecting a product from the results, users are taken to this screen, which provides comprehensive information about the chosen item. Details include a larger image, price, available quantity and any additional relevant information.

This project is built using [Android SDK/Kotlin], and follows best practices for mobile development to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. The app also incorporates efficient data handling and user interface design principles to provide a high-quality shopping experience.
